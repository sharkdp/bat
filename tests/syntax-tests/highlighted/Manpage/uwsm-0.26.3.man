[34mOPERATION OVERVIEW[0m
   Login Sequence Integration
       uwsm  can  be  launched  by using conditional exec in shell profile to replace login shell (see
       Shell Profile Integration section).

       Alternatively "uwsm start ..." command can be put into wayland session's Desktop  Entry  to  be
       launched by a display manager (see Use Inside Desktop Entry section).

   Compositor Selection
       uwsm  can  run arbitrary compositor command line or a Desktop Entry by ID (specifying Action ID
       is also supported).

       Desktop Entry can also be selected via a whiptail menu (see select subcommand section).

   Startup
       See start subcommand section for command syntax.

       UWSM uses a set of units bound to standard user session targets:

       •   wayland-session-pre@.target (bound to graphical-session-pre.target)
           •   wayland-wm-env@.service (environment preloader service)
       •   wayland-session@.target (bound to graphical-session.target)
           •   wayland-wm@.service (service for the selected compositor)
       •   wayland-session-xdg-autostart@.target (bound to xdg-desktop-autostart.target)
       •   wayland-session-envelope@.target (lives through entire lifecycle)
       •   wayland-session-shutdown.target (conflicts with targets above for shutdown)
       •   wayland-session-bindpid@.service (PID-tracking session killswitch)
       •   wayland-session-waitenv.service (delays graphical session until vars appear)

       Compositor ID (Desktop Entry ID or executable name) becomes the  specifier  for  all  templated
       units.

       At  the  stage of graphical-session-pre.target, the environment saved from "uwsm start" context
       is loaded (or POSIX shell profile is sourced), uwsm environment files are sourced. The delta is
       exported to the systemd and D-Bus activation environments by the environment preloader  service
       and  is  marked  for  cleanup  at  shutdown  stage. Preloader shell context for convenience has
       IN_UWSM_ENV_PRELOADER var set to true.

       At the stage  of  graphical-session.target  (before  it)  the  main  compositor  unit  wayland-
       wm@${ID}.service and wayland-session-waitenv.service are started.

       Compositor should at least put WAYLAND_DISPLAY variable to systemd activation environment. This
       will  trigger  uwsm's automatic finalization logic. Without WAYLAND_DISPLAY in activation envi‐
       ronment startup will timeout in 10 seconds.

       Manual finalization is possible by running "uwsm finalize" (see finalize  subcommand  section),
       also  in  combination  with  tweaking UWSM_WAIT_VARNAMES and UWSM_WAIT_VARNAMES_SETTLETIME vars
       (see Environment vars section).

       Successful activation of compositor unit and existence of WAYLAND_DISPLAY in  activation  envi‐
       ronment will allow graphical-session.target to be declared reached.

       Finally, xdg-desktop-autostart.target is activated.

   Inside session
       It  is  highly recommended to configure the compositor or app launcher to launch apps as scopes
       or services in special user session slices (app.slice, background.slice,  session.slice).  uwsm
       provides custom nested slices for apps to live in and be terminated on session end:
       •   app-graphical.slice
       •   background-graphical.slice
       •   session-graphical.slice

       A  helper app subcommand is provided to handle all the systemd-run invocations for you (see app
       subcommand section).

       The compositor is launched in session.slice by default (as recommended by [34msystemd.[0m[34mspecial[0m[35m([0m[33m7[0m[35m)[0m).

   Shutdown
       Can be initiated by either:
       •   running uwsm stop
       •   stopping wayland-wm@*.service or wayland-session-envelope@*.target
       •   starting wayland-session-shutdown.target

       Systemd stops all user units in reverse, as it usually does. During deactivation of  graphical-
       session-pre.target,  the environment preloader service cleans activation environments by unset‐
       ting all variables that were marked for removal during startup and finalization stages.

       Do not use compositor's native exit mechanism or kill its process directly.

       The first argument of the compositor command line acts as an ID and should be either one of:
       •   Executable name
       •   Desktop Entry ID (optionally with ":"[33m-delimited[0m action ID)
       •   Special value:
           •   select - invoke menu to select compositor.
           •   default - run previously selected compositor (or select if no selection was saved).

       If given as path, hardcode mode will be used implicitly.

       Always use "--" to disambiguate dashed arguments intended for compositor itself.

       After units are (re)generated, wayland-session-bindpid@${PID}.service is started, to track  the
       PID  of  invoking  uwsm, then uwsm process replaces itself with systemctl execution that starts
       wayland-wm@${ID}.service and waits for it to finish.

       In order to complete the startup sequence, the compositor has to put WAYLAND_DISPLAY  into  the
       systemd  activation environment. This can be done explicitly by making compositor run "uwsm fi‐
       nalize" command (see the next subsection).

   finalize
       For running by a compositor on startup.

           uwsm finalize [[33m-h[0m] [VAR_NAME ...]

       Exports WAYLAND_DISPLAY, DISPLAY and any defined vars mentioned by names  in  arguments  or  in
       UWSM_FINALIZE_VARNAMES variable (whitespace-separated). Then sends startup notification for the
       unit to systemd user manager.

       This  is required if compositor itself does not put WAYLAND_DISPLAY to systemd activation envi‐
       ronment, otherwise wayland-session@.service unit or a dedicated wayland-session-waitenv.service
       unit will terminate due to startup timeout.

       UWSM_FINALIZE_VARNAMES variable can be prefilled by plugins.

       Direct assignment as VAR_NAME=value is also possible, but recommended only for  creating  flags
       for UWSM_WAIT_VARNAMES mechanism.

   stop
       Stops compositor and optionally removes generated units.

       •   ping just "pong" is returnedn
       •   stop daemon is stoppedn

       Single commands are prepended with exec, iterated commands are assembled with trailing &  each,
       followed by wait.

       The  purpose  of  all this is to skip all the expensive Python startup and import routines that
       slow things down every time "uwsm app" is called. Instead the daemon does it once and then lis‐
       tens for requests, while a simple shell script may dump arguments to one pipe and run the  code
       received from another via eval, which is much faster.

       The simplest script is:

                #!/bin/sh
                printf '0%s' app "$@" > "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/uwsm-app-daemon-in"
                IFS='' read [33m-r[0m cmd < "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/uwsm-app-daemon-out"
                eval "$[33mcmd[0m"

       Provided  uwsm-app  client  script is a bit smarter: it can start the daemon, applies timeouts,
       and supports newlines in returned args.

[34mSHELL PROFILE INTEGRATION[0m
       To launch uwsm automatically on login, add one of constructs below (or similar) to  shell  pro‐
       file.

       This asks to select a compositor (or refuse and continue with login shell) when logged in on VT
       1:

                if uwsm check may-start && uwsm select; then
                     exec systemd-cat [33m-t[0m uwsm_start uwsm start default
                fi

       This just starts a specific compositor depending on foreground VT:

                if uwsm check may-start 1; then
                     exec systemd-cat [33m-t[0m uwsm_start uwsm start sway.desktop
                elif uwsm check may-start 2; then
                     exec systemd-cat [33m-t[0m uwsm_start uwsm start labwc.desktop
                fi

       Using  "uwsm  check  may-start"  as  a  condition  is essential, not only to prevent accidental
       startup attempts where they are not expected, but also since startup may involve sourcing shell
       profile, which might lead to nasty loops.

       See check subcommand section for info on may-start checker.

       exec allows uwsm to replace login shell in order to properly bind to user  session  and  handle
       session termination.

       "systemd-cat  [33m-t[0m uwsm_start" (optional) executes the command given to it (uwsm) with its stdout
       and stderr connected to the systemd journal, tagged with identifier "uwsm_start". See  systemd-
       [34mcat[0m[35m([0m[33m1[0m[35m)[0m for more options.

[34mUSE INSIDE DESKTOP ENTRY[0m
       To  launch  uwsm from a display/login manager, "uwsm start" can be used inside Desktop Entries.
       Example /usr/local/share/wayland-sessions/my-compositor.desktop:

                [Desktop Entry]
                Name=My compositor (with UWSM)
                Comment=My cool compositor
                Exec=uwsm start [33m-N[0m "My compositor" [33m-D[0m mycompositor [33m-C[0m "My cool compositor" mywm
                DesktopNames=mycompositor
                Type=Application

       Things to keep in mind:

       •   For consistency, command line arguments should mirror the keys of the entry
       •   Command in Exec= should start with "uwsm start"
       •   It should not point to itself (as a combination of Desktop Entry ID and Action ID)
       •   It should not point to a Desktop Entry ID and Action ID that also uses ‘uwsm‘

       Potentially such entries may be found and used by uwsm itself, i.e. in shell  profile  integra‐
       tion  situation,  or  when  launched manually. Following the principles above ensures uwsm will
       properly recognize itself and parse requested arguments inside the entry without any  side  ef‐
       fects.
