# Interface to test varlink implementations against.
# First you write a varlink client calling:
# Start, Test01, Test02, â€¦, Test09, End
# The return value of the previous call should be the argument of the next call.
# Then you test this client against well known servers like python or rust from
# https://github.com/varlink/
#
# Next you write a varlink server providing the same service as the well known ones.
# Now run your client against it and run well known clients like python or rust
# from https://github.com/varlink/ against your server. If all works out, then
# your new language bindings should be varlink certified.
