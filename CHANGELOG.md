- TypeScript syntax updated, see #1834 (@Enselic)

## `bat` as a library

- Deprecate `HighlightingAssets::syntaxes()` and `HighlightingAssets::syntax_for_file_name()`. Use `HighlightingAssets::get_syntaxes()` and `HighlightingAssets::get_syntax_for_path()` instead. They return a `Result` which is needed for upcoming lazy-loading work to improve startup performance. They also return which `SyntaxSet` the returned `SyntaxReference` belongs to. See #1747, #1755, #1776, #1862 (@Enselic)
- Remove `HighlightingAssets::from_files` and `HighlightingAssets::save_to_cache`. Instead of calling the former and then the latter you now make a single call to `bat::assets::build`. See #1802, #1971 (@Enselic)
- Replace  the `error::Error(error::ErrorKind, _)` struct and enum with an `error::Error` enum. `Error(ErrorKind::UnknownSyntax, _)` becomes `Error::UnknownSyntax`, etc. Also remove the `error::ResultExt` trait. These changes stem from replacing `error-chain` with `thiserror`. See #1820 (@Enselic)
- Add new `MappingTarget` enum variant `MapExtensionToUnknown`. Refer to its documentation for more information. Also mark `MappingTarget` as `#[non_exhaustive]` since more enum variants might be added in the future. See #1703 (@cbolgiano), #2012 (@Enselic)


# v0.18.3

## Bugfixes

- Bump `git2` dependency to fix build with Rust 1.54, see #1761


# v0.18.2

## Features

- Ignore known backup/template filename suffixes when selecting the syntax, see #1687 (@scop)

## Bugfixes

- Fix for a security vulnerability on Windows. Prior to this release, `bat` would execute programs called `less`/`less.exe` from the current working directory (instead of the one from `PATH`) with priority. An attacker might be able to use this by placing a malicious program in a shared directory where the user would execute `bat`. `bat` users on Windows are advised to upgrade to this version. See #1724 and #1472 (@Ry0taK).

## Other

- Add bash completion, see #1678 (@scop)

- Manpage highlighting fix, see #1511 (@keith-hall)
- `BAT_CONFIG_PATH` ignored by `bat` if non-existent, see #1550 (@sharkdp)

## Other

## New themes

- `ansi` replaces `ansi-dark` and `ansi-light`, see #1104 and #1412 (@mk12). **Breaking change:** users that were previously using one of the `ansi-*` themes should switch to `ansi`.
- The Gruvbox theme has been updated, see #1291 (@j0hnmeow). **Breaking change:** users that were previously using `gruvbox` or `gruvbox-white` should update and use `gruvbox-dark`/`gruvbox-light` instead.

## New syntaxes

- SML, see #1005 (@kopecs)

## Other

- Some syntaxes and themes have been updated to the latest version

# v0.15.2

## Bugfixes

- Fix syntax detection for files called 'rails', see #1008
- Fix potential errors with syntax detection for symlinked files, see #1001
- `--map-syntax` doesn't work with names provided through `--file-name` (@eth-p)

## Other

## Packaging

- Compilation problems with `onig_sys` on various platforms have been resolved by upgrading to `syntect 4.2`, which includes a new `onig` version that allows to build `onig_sys` without the `bindgen` dependency. This removes the need for `libclang(-dev)` to be installed to compile `bat`. Package maintainers might want to remove `clang` as a build dependency. See #650 for more details.

# v0.15.1

## Bugfixes

- Fix highlighting of Markdown files, see #963 and #977
- Fix `base16` theme (was broken since in v0.14), see #972, #934 and #979 (@mk12).
  Users suffering from #865 ("no color for bat in ssh from a Windows client") can use the `ansi-dark` and `ansi-light` themes from now on.

## New syntaxes

- Fortran, see #957
- Email (@mariozaizar)
- QML, see #962 (@pylipp)

# v0.15.0

## Features

- Add a new `--diff`/`-d` option that can be used to only show lines surrounding
  Git changes, i.e. added, removed or modified lines. The amount of additional
  context can be controlled with `--diff-context=N`. See #23 and #940

## Bugfixes

- Error message printed in the middle of the output for another file, see #946
- Performance improvements when using custom caches (via `bat cache --build`): the `bat` startup time should now be twice as fast (@lzutao).

## Themes

- Updated version of the Solarized dark/light themes, see #941

## `bat` as a library

- There are a few changes in the "low level" API (the `Config` struct has changed and
  the error handler needs a new `&mut dyn Write` argument). The high-level API is not
  affected.

# v0.14.0

## Features

- Added a new `--file-name <name>…` option to overwrite the displayed filename(s)
  in the header. This is useful when piping input into `bat`. See #654 and #892 (@neuronull).
- Added a new `--generate-config-file` option to create an initial configuration file
  at the right place. See #870 (@jmick414)

## Bugfixes

- Performance problems with C# source code have been fixed, see #677 (@keith-hall)
- Performance problems with Makefiles have been fixed, see #750 (@keith-hall)
- Fix bug when highlighting Ruby files with unindented heredocs, see #914 (@keith-hall)
- A highlighting problem with Rust source code has been fixed, see #924 (@keith-hall)
- Windows: short files that do not require paging are displayed and then lost, see #887
- `--highlight-line` did not work correctly in combination with `--tabs=0` and `--wrap=never`,
  see #937

## Other

- When saving/reading user-provided syntaxes or themes, `bat` will now maintain a
  `metadata.yaml` file which includes information about the `bat` version which was
  used to create the cached files. When loading cached files, we now print an error
  if they have been created with an incompatible version. See #882
- Updated `liquid` dependency to 0.20, see #880 (@ignatenkobrain)

## `bat` as a library

- A completely new "high level" API has been added that is much more convenient
  to use. See the `examples` folder for the updated code. The older "low level"
  API is still available (basically everything that is not in the root `bat`
  module), but has been refactored quite a bit. It is recommended to only use
  the new "high level" API, if possible. This will be much easier to keep stable.
  Note that this should still be considered a "beta" release of `bat`-as-a-library.
  For more details and some screenshots of the example programs, see #936.
- Stripped out a lot of binary-only dependencies, see #895 and #899 (@dtolnay)

  This introduces a `features = ["application"]` which is enabled by default and pulls in
  everything required by `bat` the application. When depending on bat as a library, downstream
  `Cargo.toml` should disable this feature to cut out inapplicable heavy dependencies:
  ``` toml
  [dependencies]
  bat = { version = "0.14", default-features = false }
  ```
  Other optional functionality has also been put behind features: `paging` and `git` support.
- Allow using the library with older syntect, see #896 and #898 (@dtolnay)

## New syntaxes

- Rego, see #872 (@patrick-east)
- Stylo, see #917


# v0.13.0

## `bat` as a library

Beginning with this release, `bat` can be used as a library (#423).

This was a huge effort and I want to thank all people who made this possible: @DrSensor, @mitsuhiko, @mre, @eth-p!

- Initial attempt in #469 (@mitsuhiko)
- Second attempt, complete restructuring of the `bat` crate, see #679 (@DrSensor)
- Updates to example, public API, error handling, further refactoring: #693 #873 #875 (@sharkdp)

I want to stress that this is the very first release of the library. Things are very likely to change. A lot of things are still missing (including the documentation).

That being said, you can start using it! See the example programs in [`examples/`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/tree/master/examples).

You can see the API documentation here: https://docs.rs/bat/

## Features

- (**Breaking change**) Glob-based syntax mapping, see #877 and #592. With this change,
  users need to update their bat config files (`bat --config-file`), if they have any `--map-syntax` settings
  present.

  The option now works like this:
  ```bash
  --map-syntax <glob-pattern>:<syntax-name>
  ```

  For more information, see the `--help` text, the man page or the README.

  This new feature allows us to properly highlight files like:
  * `/etc/profile`
  * `~/.ssh/config`

- `--highlight-line` now accepts line ranges, see #809 (@lkalir)
- Proper wrapping support for output with wide Unicode characters, see #811 #787 and #815 (@Kogia-sima)
- A lot of updates to existing syntaxes via #644 (@benwaffle, @keith-hall)
- `BAT_CACHE_PATH` can be used to place cached `bat` assets in a non-standard path, see #829 (@neuronull)
- Support combination of multiple styles at the same time, see #857 (@aslpavel)

## Bugfixes

- Do not pass '--no-init' on newer less versions, see #749 and #786 (@sharkdp)
- 'bat cache' still takes precedence over existing files, see #666 (@sharkdp)
- `.sc` files should be treated as scala files, see #443 (@benwaffle)
- Allow underscores and dashes in page names, see #670 (@LunarLambda)

# v0.12.1

## Bugfixes

- Fixes a bug for older Windows versions (*"The procedure entry point `CreateFile2` could not be located"*), see #643 (@rivy)

# v0.12.0

## Features

- Binary file content can now be viewed with `bat -A`, see #623, #640 (@pjsier and @sharkdp)

- Add new style component to separate multiple `--line-range`s, see #570 (@eth-p)
- Added `-L` as an alias for `--list-languages`

## Bugfixes

- Output looks unbalanced when using '--style=grid,numbers' without 'header', see #571 (@eth-p)
- issues with filenames starting with "cache", see #584
- Can't build cache with new theme without creating cache dir, see #576 (@frm)
- `--terminal-width -10` is parsed incorrectly, see #611

# v0.11.0

## Features

- Three new special color themes are available: `ansi-light`, `ansi-dark` and `base16`. These
  are useful for people that often switch from dark to light themes in their terminal emulator
  or for people that want the colors to match their terminal theme colors. For more details,
  see #543 and #490 (@mk12, implementation idea by @trishume)

## Changes

- **Change the default configuration directory on macOS** to `~/.config/bat`, see #442 (@lavifb). If you are on macOS, you need to copy your configuration directory from the previous place (`~/Library/Preferences/bat`) to the new place (`~/.config/bat`).

  ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c3e769482ef3184f6be6adaa34bdc8d19c378254/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f324b54486859542e706e67)

  see #395 and #381 for more details.

- Added `--pager` option (to configure the pager from the configuration file), see #362 (@majecty)

- Added `BAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to set a non-default path for `bat`s configuration file, see #375 (@deg4uss3r)

- Allow for multiple occurrences of `--style` to allow for the configuration
  of styles from the config file, see #367 (@sindreij)

- Allow for multiple `--line-range` arguments, see #23

- The `--terminal-width` option can now also accept offsets, see #376

## Changes

- Use of italics is now *disabled by default* (see #389 for details). They can be
  re-enabled by adding `--italic-text=always` to your configuration file.

- The default tab-width has been set to 4.

- Added new "Sublime Snazzy" theme.

- Shell completions are currently *not* shipped anymore, see #372 for details.

## Bugfixes

- Avoid endless recursion when `PAGER="bat"`, see #383 (@rodorgas)

## Other

- `bat` is now available on openSUSE, see #405 (@dmarcoux)

- Added section about the new configuration file in the README (@deg4uss3r)

- Chinese translation of README (@chinanf-boy)

- Re-written tests for `--tabs` (@choznerol)

- Speed up integration tests, see #394

# v0.8.0

## Features

- Support for a configuration file with the following simple format:

  ```bash
  --tabs=4
  --theme="Sublime Snazzy"

  # A line-comment
  --map-syntax .ignore:.gitignore
  --map-syntax PKGBUILD:bash
  --map-syntax Podfile:ruby

  # Flags and options can also be on a single line:
  --wrap=never --paging=never
  ```

  The configuration file path can be accessed via `bat --config-file`. On Linux,
  it is stored in `~/.config/bat/config`.

- Support for the `BAT_OPTS` environment variable with the same format as specified
  above (in a single line). This takes precedence over the configuration file.

  See also #310.

- Support for custom syntax mappings via the `-m`/`--max-syntax` option.

  This allows users to (re)map certain file extensions or file names to an existing syntax:

  ``` bash
  bat --map-syntax .config:json ...
  ```

  The option can be use multiple times. Note that you can easily make these mappings permanent by using bats new configuration file.
