# Contributing

Thank you for considering to contribute to `bat`!



## Add an entry to the changelog

If your contribution changes the behavior of `bat` (as opposed to a typo-fix
in the documentation), please update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file
and describe your changes. This makes the release proess much easier and
therefore helps to get your changes into a new `bat` release faster.

The top of the `CHANGELOG` contains a *"unreleased"* section with a few
subsections (Features, Bugfixes, â€¦). Please add your entry to the subsection
that best describes your change

Entries follow this format:
```
- Short description of what has been changed, see #123 (@user)
```
Here, `#123` is the number of the original issue and/or your pull request.
Please replace `@user` by your GitHub username.
