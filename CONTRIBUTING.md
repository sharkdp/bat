### Add an entry to the changelog

Please don't forget to update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and describe your changes (in the "unreleased" section), this makes the release of a new `bat` version much easier.

Each entry should follow the following format:
```
- Short description of what has been changed, see #123 (@user)
```

Where `#123` is your PR's number or ticket and `@user` is you Github's username.
