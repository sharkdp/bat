## Sponsors

Please note, that being sponsored does not affect the individuality of the `bat`
project or affect the maintainers' actions in any way.
We remain impartial and continue to assess pull requests solely on merit - the
features added, bugs solved, and effect on the overall complexity of the code.
No issue will have a different priority based on sponsorship status of the
reporter.

Contributions from anybody are most welcomed, please see our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
